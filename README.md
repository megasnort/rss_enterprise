# RSS Enterprise

In my opinion, existing RSS Readers make everything to complicated. I just want to

- subscribe to feeds
- view one list with the unread news items of all the feeds
- view the body of these news item by walking this list
- open the news item in the default browser, in the background
- have a RSS Reader with a hilarious name

For now, nothing works, except the loading of some feeds defined in a settings file.
