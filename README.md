# RSS Enterprise

In my opinion, existing RSS Readers make everything to complicated. I just want to

- subscribe to feeds
- view one list with the unread news items of all the feeds
- view the body of these news item by walking this list
- open the news item in the default browser, in the background

Older versions of NetNewsWire were able to provide this functionality but since I moved to linux I no longer have that choice.

The name? Trekkies will find it hilarious. That is reason enough.
