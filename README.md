# RSS Enterprise

In my opinion, existing RSS Readers make everything to complicated. I just want to

- subscribe to feeds
- view one list with the unread news items of all the feeds
- view the body of these news item by walking this list
- open the news item in the default browser, in the background
- have a RSS Reader with a hilarious name


## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary [requirements](requirements.txt) in a Python 3.6 environment, boot the program with

```bash
python rss_enterprise.py
```

Walk through the items with the arrow keys or mouse. Press ENTER to open in your default browser.
